Summary of App Requirements and Goals:
The app developed aimed to address user needs related to managing personal information such as inventory items, event details, or daily weight. It required a robust user authentication system, a persistent database for data storage, and features for creating, updating, and deleting items. Additionally, the app incorporated SMS messaging notifications for alerts based on specific triggers, enhancing user engagement.

Screens and Features for User-Centered UI:
Screens included login/authentication, a grid displaying database information, and interfaces for creating, updating, and deleting items. The UI design prioritized simplicity, intuitive navigation, and clear feedback to ensure a user-friendly experience. The use of visual elements, such as grids and well-organized forms, aimed to enhance user understanding and efficiency.

Approach to Coding:
The coding process involved the systematic development of functionalities, beginning with user authentication, database creation, and CRUD operations. Utilizing Java in Android Studio, I employed industry-standard best practices, including concise classes, consistent coding style, and thorough in-line comments for enhanced readability. This approach ensures maintainability and collaboration in future development.

Testing for Functional Code:
Regular testing was conducted using the Android Emulator to ensure the functionality of user authentication, database operations, and SMS notifications. This process is crucial for identifying and addressing bugs or issues early in the development cycle, ensuring a stable and reliable app for end-users.

Innovation to Overcome Challenges:
In the app design and development process, innovation was required in creating a seamless integration between the SMS messaging feature and user permissions. Balancing functionality while respecting user privacy became a focal point, and implementing a system where the app continues to operate gracefully even if SMS permissions are denied showcased innovative problem-solving.

Successful Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills:
Demonstrating knowledge and skills was particularly successful in designing the database structure and implementing CRUD operations. The incorporation of persistent storage and efficient management of user data showcased a deep understanding of data handling within the Android environment, contributing to the app's overall success.
